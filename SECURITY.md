# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As I'm not running different versions of the project. The lastest version will be supported by providing security patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### High Risk

In case you see a severe security issue that may serve someone to exploit the current production please do not create an issue. Instead contact me via email
with a concreate description on the attack vector, if possible describe how I will be able to reproduce the exploit in a staging system. 
You may also suggest a solution how to mitigate the possible risk. If I do not response within 30 days try to contact me again and after another 30 days you
may raise the exploit via issuing a ticket.

### Medium to low risks

Please file an issue ticket with label enhancement and security.
