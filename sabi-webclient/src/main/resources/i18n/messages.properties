From scratch Sabi comes with support for German and English. If more users with a different background will be observed,\
a volunteered translater will be seeked. Sabi will set these parameter to English as default, you may adopt these\
afterwards in your useres profile. Are you a developer and master a different tongue have a look on sabi at github ;-)
register.gdpr.t=Sabi stores your registration data for the purpose to identify your useraccount. Additionally and assigned to your user account, \
  all measurements data and information given on your seawater tank inhabitants will be stored. The sum of all measurments and tank data provided by all user \
  will be evaluated under semi-scientific aspects and the results will be available to all users in anonymized form. All data will be stored within the bounds of the EU and \
  won't shared with other 3rd parties without your permission.\
  To fulfill the information request duty of GDPR Sabi has integrated an export functionality within the report page, from where you can download the measurement data you provided in Sabi.
register.welcome.t=Thank you in supporting the Sabi-Project and welcome! Sabi won't act as competitor to all the valuable\
seawater aquaristic user forums out there and does not intent to offer forum functionalities.\
The focus is on the scientific approach. Participants benefits from a grafical representation of their \
submitted measurment data and from generated insights based on data analysis. \
Currently the project is in stage I (collecting of data). As soon as enough participants have collected \
sufficient measurment data, we will initiate stage II (Analysis).
preregistration.info.t=Almost perfect. Your choosen username and password has been accepted.\
Within the next minute you should retrieve an email with an activation link to validate your email-address.\
Once the email has been validated, you can use your credentials to log into sabi \

<ul>\
<li>As Developer via github</li>\
<li>As Participant in sharing your metric data</li>\
<li>As Sponsor to take care of material and operational costs.</li>\
</ul>\
\
<p>As project sponsor and owner I spent quite a lot of my spare time making conceptional, programming and operational work.\
Taking over the initial operational costs for sabis first data center (homebased raspberry pis)...\
However there are hopefully some of you that are willing to let Sabis operational platform grow to place it on a solid basis.\
To make your invests transparent I will show here how the money is being invested.</p>

plague.center.introduction.h=Welcome at SABIs Plague Center. What is it about?
plague.center.introduction.t=The core vision of SABI is to identify possible correlations between water quality measurements and plagues. \
To make this possible, not only the water values must be recorded regularly, but also the occurrence and \
course of specific plagues must be recorded in a structured way. If the project is successful, we can \
derive the probability of occurrence of plagues in the marine aquarium based on the reported water values \
and act as a kind of early warning system with recommendations for appropriate countermeasures.
