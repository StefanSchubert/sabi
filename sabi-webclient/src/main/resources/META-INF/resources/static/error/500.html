                Sorry, there was an unplanned error.
            </p>
            <p>
            Currently there is one known issue with returning users
            which was raised already <a href="https://github.com/StefanSchubert/sabi/issues/113">here.</a>
            This is currently caused with a broken client side view state due to a server redeployment.
                </p>
            <p>Unfortunate this problem has nit been solved yet.
            The workaround is to re-login by going into browsers URL field and remove everything after the last "/" and hit enter again.
            </p>

            <p>
                Just in case the problem has not been solved by the workaround:</b>
                YOU can still help! If you can reproduce the error please submit a trouble ticket with detail description what happened
                and led to the problem at: projects <a href="https://github.com/StefanSchubert/sabi/issues">Issues</a>
                tracker.<br/>
                Before open an own ticket, have a look if some other already reported a problem and leave a comment
                there instead.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks for supporting the project and sorry for any inconvenience caused.
            </p>
