                Sorry for that, but no reason to worry ;-)<br/>

                Some exception in the frontend logic occurred I probably haven't considered yet.
                Please try again: <a href="/">https://sabi-project.net/</a> and if that doesn't fix it
                consider the suggested feedback in the next paragraph.
            </p>

            <p>
                Good news is: YOU can help! First wait a while and try again.
                If you can reproduce the error please submit a trouble ticket with detail description what happened
                and led to the problem at: projects <a href="https://github.com/StefanSchubert/sabi/issues">Issues</a>
                tracker.<br/>
                Before open an own ticket, have a look if some other already reported a problem and leave a comment
                there instead.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thanks for supporting the project and sorry for any inconvenience caused.
