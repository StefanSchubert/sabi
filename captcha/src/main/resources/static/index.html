    <title>Captcha light REST API Service</title>
</head>

<h1>Welcome to Captcha light</h1>

<p>Captcha light aims to provide software developers with a simple captcha mechanism to start with while bootstrapping a new
    product idea. To do so, this approach provides captcha as a RESTful microservice component based upon spring boot, which you can
    include within your product environment and you may adopt to your needs if required.</p>

<h2>Why you would use Captcha light, or captcha mechanisms in general?</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>If you are going to deploy some self developed service and want to protect it against the denial of service
        attack vector of automated registrations.</li>
    <li>If you want to protect your users from password-forgotten workflow emails, triggered by a bot. (You may loose users, if you don't care about it).</li>
    <li>You won't rely on some offered captcha services out there, and think of offering this functionality as part of your product, so that the
    service is within your control (by means that you are able to exchange the captcha question set even according to your problem oder service context).</li>
    <li>It's free and simple to integrate.</li>
    </ol>


<h2>Why would you want exchange captcha light?</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>This captcha service is simple. A hacker will be able to write brute force algorithms to enable bots to scope with it.</li>
    <li>Your service or product has grown out of child-hood and you require a serious solution, as you may become more attractive be hackers.</li>
    <li>captcha service in general (even professional solutions) are getting weaker as protective measures as KI is getting more and more powerfull.
    That's why all the big-player are switching to two factor authorizations and you are planning to do so, too. </li>
</ul>
